# API File Parser
A simple tool for parsing files received by our API endpoint. In this project we only made provision for `text/csv` file format, however you could extend it based on your requirements.

## Features:

- Automatic detection of file format based on extension
- Parsing received files to a dictionary
- Error handling for unsupported file types
